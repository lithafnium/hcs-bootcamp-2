I tried to use the K-Nearest Neighbors method by predicting the winner of a tennis match based off of rankings. Looking back, I think given the dataset that a K-means clustering method might have applied better. The dataset I used came from here: https://www.kaggle.com/gmadevs/atp-matches-dataset/download. 

The API that I tried to implement was that the user would enter in two ranks and the classifier would predict who would win. Unfortunately, I don't believe I implemented the classifier correctly. Future steps would be to add more depth to this classifier by considering more variables besides rank, which could include country, points won, surface, etc.
